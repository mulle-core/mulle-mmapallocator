mulle-mmapallocator can be used to create memory allocations shared across
process boundaries. Due to cross-platform considerations, the memory to be
shared with the other processes must be pre-allocated at initialization time.

mulle-mmapallocator can also be used to create a separate allocation
space, which can then easily be reclaimed by destroying the allocator.
